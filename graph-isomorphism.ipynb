    "    1. The input to the CDP is (G, k)\n",
    "    2. The output of this is true of the graph G contains a clique of size k\n",
    "    3. Let G1 be a complete graph of k vertices and G2 be G where G1, G2 \n",
    "       are inputs to the subgraph problem.\n",
    "    4. We see that k <= n, where n is the number of vertices in G\n",
    "    5. If k > n, a clique of size k cannot be a subgraph of G\n",
    "    6. Time taken to create G1 is O(k^2) - O(n^2)\n",
    "    7. G has a clique of size k if G1 is subgraph of G2\n",
    "    8. As G1 itself is a subgraph of G2 and every graph is isomorphic to \n",
    "       itself\n",
    "    9. The result of the Subgraph problem is true\n",
    "    10. G1 is isomorphic to subgrpah of G2\n",
    "    11. If CDP is true the Subgraph problem is true and vice versa\n",
    "    12. This means the CDP can be reduced in polynomial time\n",
    "    13. This means the subgraph problem is NP-Hard"
