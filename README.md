# Graph Theory Assessment

This is my assignment submission for the Graph Theory module. First I had to create two 
Jupyter Notebooks, before going out and researching and discussing the Heap Sort Algorithm and The Graph Isomorphism Problem.


## Technologies

- Jupyter Notebook
- Python (Anaconda)



## Installation

- Install for Anaconda Python - https://www.anaconda.com/
- Jupyter Notebook is automatically installed with Anaconda
- Cmder (for a more powerful command line) - https://cmder.net/

#### Versions used if you want to use in WSL or linux system:
- jupyter core     : 4.6.3
- jupyter-notebook : 6.0.3
- Python 3.10.4

#### Other Libraries that you may need:

```bash
sudo pip install networkx
```
```bash
sudo pip install matplotlib
```

## Features

#### Heap Sort Notebook Including:
- Explanation of heap sort algorithm
- Python function implementing heap sort
- Explanation of the computational complexity of heap sort
- Explanation of how graph theory is used in heap sort

#### Graph Isomorphism Problem Notebook Including:
- Explanation of the Graph Isomorphism Problem
- Explanation of how graphs are represented in data structures
- Python fucntion implementing an algorithm to see if two graphs are Isomorphic or not
- Discussion of the computational complexity of the Graph Isomorphism Problem

## Usage
To use these notebooks for yourself follow the steps below.

- Start by cloning the repository into a folder
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DylanMorr/Graph-Theory-Assessment
```
- cd into the folder
```bash
cd Graph-Theory-Assessment
```
- Run the command jupyter notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
- From there you can edit the notebook yourself and read them.
